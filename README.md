# zrLeaflet

A practice about integrate Leaflet and ZRender, using zrender display geojson in Leaflet map. 

When drawing large amounts of data, in order to increase user friendliness and reduce latency, I used a tiled canvas to drawing objects.

But as soon as I finished, I realized that it was useless, or extremely limited in scope. :(
